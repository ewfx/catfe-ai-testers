#Based on the provided React component code, I've analyzed its functionality and generated comprehensive Gherkin-style BDD feature scenarios for the `LoanRequestForm` component. Here's the result:
#
#**Feature File: LoanRequestForm.feature**
#```gherkin
# Feature: Loan Request Form

Feature: Loan Request Form

  Scenario: User submits loan request form
    Given I am on the loan request form page
    When I enter customer ID, loan amount, credit score, debt to income ratio, and employment status
    Then the form is submitted successfully with the provided information
    And the loan request is processed with the default values

  Scenario: User submits empty fields
    Given I am on the loan request form page
    When I submit the form without entering any fields
    Then an error message is displayed indicating required fields
    And no loan request is processed
#
  Scenario: User submits form with invalid data
    Given I am on the loan request form page
    When I enter invalid data for customer ID, loan amount, credit score, debt to income ratio, and employment status
    Then an error message is displayed indicating validation errors
    And no loan request is processed
#
  Scenario: User submits form with valid data
    Given I am on the loan request form page
    When I enter valid data for customer ID, loan amount, credit score, debt to income ratio, and employment status
    Then the form is submitted successfully with the provided information
    And the loan request is processed with the correct values
#
#  Scenario: User resets form fields
#    Given I am on the loan request form page
#    When I reset the form fields using the default values
#    Then all form fields are reset to their default values
#
#  Scenario: User submits form without submitting button clicked
#    Given I am on the loan request form page
#    When I submit the form without clicking the submit button
#    Then an error message is displayed indicating that the form was not submitted successfully
#    And no loan request is processed

# End of Feature File

#These scenarios cover various user interactions and expected behaviors for the `LoanRequestForm` component, including:
#
#* Submitting the form with valid or invalid data
#* Resetting form fields to their default values
#* Submitting the form without clicking the submit button
#* Handling edge cases such as empty fields or invalid data
#
#Note that these scenarios assume the component's behavior is well-defined and follows standard React principles. If the component's implementation deviates from these assumptions, additional scenarios may be needed to cover its specific behavior.
#
#Also, you can add more scenarios based on your requirements, for example:
#
#* Test the form handling multiple inputs
#* Test the form validation with international characters
#* Test the accessibility of the form
#
#You can run these scenarios using a Gherkin parser such as Cucumber or JUnit with Gherkin.
